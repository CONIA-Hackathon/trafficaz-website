### Web Interface Interaction

Once you've launched the application locally, you'll land on an interactive demo page.

1.  **Explore the Hero Section**: The initial section introduces TrafficAz with dynamic stats and interactive elements. You can click "Experience Demo" to scroll down to the main demonstration area.
2.  **How It Works Section**: Discover the core workflow of TrafficAz, from voice activation to emergency alerts. Each step is visually represented, illustrating the system's intelligent flow.
3.  **Powerful Features**: Delve into the advanced AI capabilities and driver safety features explained in a clear, concise manner.
4.  **Interactive Demo**: The "Experience the Future" section allows you to simulate real-time traffic requests:
    *   **Voice AI (Default)**: Click "Start Voice Demo" to simulate a voice command interaction. Watch as the "Voice Interface" processes the request and the "Live Map Tracking" updates with simulated traffic conditions and speed. The "Live Alerts" section will also reflect system responses.
    *   **USSD**: Switch to the "USSD" tab and click "Dial USSD" to simulate sending a USSD code. Observe the information flow and how the map and alerts respond. This demonstrates accessibility for feature phones.
    *   **SMS**: Select the "SMS" tab and click "Send SMS" to simulate sending an SMS message. See how TrafficAz processes text-based requests and provides updates.

The live map will continuously update with simulated user movement and changing traffic levels (Light, Moderate, Heavy) based on the simulated speed. The "System Status" and "Live Alerts" panels will also provide real-time feedback on the demo's progress.
